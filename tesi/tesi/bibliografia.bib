	abstract = {SUMO is an open source traffic simulation package including the simulation
	application itself as well as supporting tools, mainly for network import
	and demand modeling. SUMO helps to investigate a large variety of research topics,
	mainly in the context of traffic management and vehicular communications.
	We describe the current state of the package, its major applications,
	both by research topic and by example, as well as future developments and extensions.}
