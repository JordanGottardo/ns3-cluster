	abstract = "Network simulation tools are frequently used to analyze the performance of MANET protocols and applications. Currently they offer only simple wireless communication models that neglect many radio propagation effects. In this paper, we integrate a more realistic physical layer model into a simulation tool. It consists of a radio propagation model and a model of wireless transmission errors. They have been evaluated against real-world measurements. We prove that such more realistic models change simulation results considerably. To the best of our knowledge, no other study of MANETs has been performed so far with such a detailed physical layer model. Hence, this paper also gives new insights on the performance of MANETs in real outdoor environments."
