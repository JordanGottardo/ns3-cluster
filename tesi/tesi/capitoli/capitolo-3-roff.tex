\chapter{ROFF}
\label{chapter:roff}

RObust and Fast Forwarding scheme (ROFF) is a protocol proposed by Hongseok Yoo and Dongkyun Kim in \cite{6906275}. This chapter will present the two main problems tackled by ROFF already introduced in Section \ref{sec:emd}, namely the perfect suppression of redundant transmissions, which will be explained in section TODO, and the disuniformity and the costant change in spatial vehicle distribution in VANETs, addressed in section TODO.
