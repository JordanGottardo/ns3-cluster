\chapter{Simulations}
	After the protocols under consideration have been presented in Chapters \ref{chapter:fb} and \ref{chapter:roff}, this Chapter will contain the results of the simulation carried out through various scenario of increasing complexity.
	
	\section{Metrics}
		Before proceeding with the presentation of simulation results, metrics used to evaluate the protocol's performances will be presented in this section. 
		
		\subsection{Total Delivery Ratio (TDR)}
			\label{ssec:tdr}
			This metric is used to detect how many vehicles have received the Alert Message in total. Ideally, broadcasting protocols should be able to reach all the reachable nodes in the scenario in order to warn them of the danger. The metric is calculated as follows:
			
			\begin{gather}
				\label{eq:tdr}
				TDR = \frac{\textrm{\textit{no. of vehicles successfully receiving the Alert Message}}}{\textrm{\textit{no. of vehicles in the scenario}}}
			\end{gather}
			
			All scenarios are created in a way such that every node can be reached by multi-hop propagation regardless of the source of the Alert Message. In other words, from graph theory point of view, the graph resulting from vehicle distribution where two nodes are connected only if they are within transmission range of each other is a connected graph. This way, the term at the denominator of Equation \ref{eq:tdr} is equivalent to the number of vehicles reachable by pure flooding.
			
		\subsection{Total Delivery Ratio On Circumference (TDROC)}
			This metric is used to detect how many vehicles on the circumference have received the Alert Message. The circumference is built starting from the source of the Alert Message. The way it is built depends on scenario topology (e.g. 1D, 2D, etc) and will be explained more thoroughly in the following Sections. The main idea behind the circumference consists in considering only vehicles far from the source of the AM. The metric is calculated as follows:
			
			\begin{gather}
			 	\label{eq:tdroc}
			 	TDROC = \frac{\textrm{\textit{no. of vehicles on circ. successfully receiving the Alert Message}}}{\textrm{\textit{no. of vehicles on circ.}}}
			\end{gather}
		
			The same consideration about vehicles and reachability by pure flooding presented in Section \ref{ssec:tdr} is also valid for Equation \ref{eq:tdroc}.
			
		\subsection{Number Of Hops (NOH)}
			This metric is used to measure the mean number of hops required in order to propagate the Alert Message from the source to all vehicles reached on the circumference. This value is obviously dependent on the paths taken by forwarder Alert Messages from the source to all destinations. We have that \textit{ONOH} is always greater than or equal to the \textit{Optimal Number of Hops BNOH} (i.e. $ONOH \leq NOH$). \textit{BNOH} is calculated using the following formula:
			$$ BNOH = \frac{\textrm{\textit{Circumference Radius}}}{\textrm{\textit{Transmission Range}}} $$
			
			The Number Of Hops metric can be calculated as:
			
			\begin{gather}
				\label{eq:noh}
				NOH = \frac{ \sum_{p \in RC } \textrm{\textit{no. of hops from source to p}}} {\textrm{\textit{no. of vehicles on circ}}}
			\end{gather}
			
			where $RC$ is the set of vehicles which have successfully received the message on the circumference.
			
			
			The \textit{NOH} metric (whose value should be as close as possible to \textit{BNOH} ) is an important indicator of the effectiveness of the multi-hop protocol in choosing the farthest forwarder during contention.
			
			
			Figure \ref{fig:hops} can be used as an example to calculate \textit{NOH}. Using Equation \ref{eq:noh}, the mean number of hops is equal to 3.
			
			\begin{figure}[H]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{immagini/hops}
				\caption{Example of \textit{NOH} calculation with Alert Message starting from node S}
				\label{fig:hops}
			\end{figure}
			
		\subsection{Number Of Slots (NOS)}
			This metric is used to measure the number of slots required in order to propagate the Alert Message from the source to all vehicles reached on the circumference. High values of this metric means that the multi-hop protocol introduces a lot of waiting time before each forwarding, hence increasing end-to-end delay and hurting the timeliness of the emergency message propagation.
		
			\begin{gather}
				\label{eq:slots}
				NOH = \frac{ \sum_{p \in RC } \textrm{\textit{no. of slots waited along path from source to p}}} {\textrm{\textit{no. of vehicles on circ}}}
			\end{gather}	
	
			where $RC$ is the set of vehicles which have successfully received the message on the circumference
			The number of slots along the path from node $a$ to $b$ at the numerator of Equation \ref{eq:slots} is the sum of the slots waited by each forwarder before relaying the Alert Message. 
			
			
			Based on the scenario represented in Figure \ref{fig:slots} and Equation \ref{eq:slots}, the mean number of slots from source S to nodes on the circumference is 100.

				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{immagini/slots}
				\caption{Example of \textit{NOS} calculation with Alert Message starting from node S}
				\label{fig:slots}
			\end{figure}
			
			
		\subsection{Forward Node Ratio (FNR)}
			This metric is used to measure the number of vehicles which forward the Alert Message. The value of this metric is an indicator of the effectiveness of the multi-hop protocol in successfully suppressing scheduled transmissions from PFCs after the FFC has relayed the message. The metric is calculated as follows:
			 
			\begin{gather}
				\label{eq:nos}
				NOH = \textrm{\textit{no. of vehicles forwarding the Alert Message}}
			\end{gather}	
				
	\section{Platoon scenario}
		The first scenario taken into consideration is a simple platoon scenario, where vehicles are placed in a strip-like area 15 kilometers long. Vehicles are 25 meters distant from each other.  Transmission ranges of 100, 300 and 500 has been employed during simulations. 
		Parameters for this scenario are included in Table \ref{table:platoon}.

		\end{table}
	
		\begin{figure}[H]

		\end{figure}
	
		Since this scenario is one-dimensional, the circumference simply consists in vehicles distant $14.000  \pm 12$ meters from the source of Alert Message. Both metrics about Delivery Ratio (global and on circumference) are close to 100\%, so the algorithms successfully propagate the AM until the end of the platoon.
		
		
		Considering the Number Of Hops, ROFF's results are 11,76\%, 6,54\% and 9,08\% lower than Fast-Broadcast's results respectively for 100, 300 and 500 meters transmission range. ROFF's results are close to the optimal number of hops, respectively 140, 46,6 and 28 for the same transmission ranges as above. This means that the forwarder selection algorithms based on ESD Bitmap works better in choosing the farthest vehicle from the previous forwarder compared to the contention window approach for 1D scenarios. Considering STATIC variants of Fast-Broadcast, it is possible to observe that the STATIC-tx variant produces comparable results with Fast-Broadcast with \textit{tx} transmission range (e.g. STATIC-100 value is comparable to Fast-Broadcast with 100 meters transmission range), as expected. The STATIC protocol performs worse (hence the Number of Hops increases) whenever the transmission range is underestimated (e.g. STATIC-100 with 300 meters transmission range, compared to Fast-Broadcast with the same transmission range) or overestimated (e.g. STATIC-500 with 100 meters transmission range, compared to Fast-Broadcast with the same transmission range). This behaviour is expected, as reported in \cite{BAR2017}.
		
		
		Regarding the Number of Slots, ROFF's performs much better than Fast-Broadcast. The metric's value is decreased respectively by 97,92\%, 92,27\% and 90,85\%  using ROFF. The waiting time calculation, based on unique forwarding priority instead of distance, guarantees a much lower wait compared to Fast-Broadcast contention window approach. As before, STATIC approaches produce results comparable with Fast-Broadcast when the transmission range estimation is correct. Instead, the Number of Slots greatly increases when the transmission range is underestimated and decreases when the transmission range is overestimated. In this last case, the decrease in NOS comes with an increase in Number Of Hops reported in the previous paragraph, so an overestimation of transmission range is not desirable.
		
		
		Lastly, it is possible to see that ROFF's achieves a better suppression of redundant transmissions, guaranteeing a decrease of 19,71\%, 33,33\% and 42,31\$ respectively for each one of the transmission ranges considered.
		
		
	\section{Grid scenario}
		After tests on the 1D Platoon scenario have been carried out, the next step consisted in testing the algorithms' performances in a 2D Grid scenario, employing also the shadowing model introduced in \ref{sec:shadowing}.
		Parameters for this scenario are included in Table \ref{tab:grid}.

	\section{Los Angeles urban scenario}
		The next step consisted in expanding the 2D scenario with realistic urban data taken from OpenStreetMap and processed by SUMO as explained in Section \ref{sec:sumo}. In addition to the shadowing model, in this scenario (and also in the urban scenario regarding Padua, which will be presented in the next section), a \textit{smart junction} variant of the algorithms has been introduced in order to try to increase the delivery ratios. All configurations are reported in Figure \ref{fig:la-overview}. Parameters for this scenario are included in Table \ref{tab:la-25}.
